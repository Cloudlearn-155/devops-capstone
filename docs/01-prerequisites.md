# Prerequisites

## KVM

This tutorial leverages KVM. So you need to have a linux machine on which KVM is installed.

You can find how to install KVM on any linux distribution on the Internet.

In this tutorial, [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed) will be used, but in most cases, there should be no problem caused by specific distributions or libvirt versions.
